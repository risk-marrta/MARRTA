# About Window Mockups and Visualizations

This directory contains visual mockups and reference images for the redesigned About window.

## Files

### 1. about_window_mockup.png
A visual mockup showing the complete layout of the new About window, including:
- Title and version information
- Description text
- Society logos (AETR, SEFM, SEOR, SEPR) in a single row
- CSN logo prominently displayed
- Sponsor logos (Fundaci√≥n MAPFRE and Ministerio)
- Author information
- Collaboration information
- VorticeSoft logo
- OK button

This mockup demonstrates the spacing, layout, and visual hierarchy of the redesigned window.

### 2. about_changes_summary.png
A comprehensive summary image highlighting all the changes made:
- **Removed**: Emiral logo and company_logo.png
- **Added**: ministerio.png and csn.png
- **Updated**: All society logos (aetr, sefm, seor, sepr)
- **New Content**: Author and collaboration information
- **Layout Improvements**: Window size, layout type, and visual organization

### 3. logos_composite.png
A composite image showing all the new/updated logo placeholder images:
- Ministerio
- CSN
- AETR
- SEFM
- SEOR
- SEPR

These are currently placeholder images that should be replaced with actual high-resolution logos.

## Usage

These mockups are for reference and documentation purposes. They help visualize:
1. The final appearance of the About window
2. The changes made during the redesign
3. The placeholder logos that need to be replaced

## Next Steps

1. Build the Qt application to see the actual About window
2. Replace placeholder logos with official high-resolution versions
3. Compare the actual implementation with these mockups
4. Make any necessary adjustments to match the design intent

## Notes

- All mockups were created programmatically using Python and PIL (Pillow)
- The actual Qt window will use the real logo images from `resources/logos/`
- Current logos are placeholders - see `ABOUT_WINDOW_CHANGES.md` for replacement instructions
